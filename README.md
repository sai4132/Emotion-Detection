# Emotion-Detection
This project is a part of DA-526: Image Processing with Machine Learning course. We are using "emotion-detection-fer" dataset from Kaggle. 

The dataset contain 35,685 examples of 48x48 pixel gray scale images of faces divided into train and test dataset. Images are categorized based on the emotion shown in the facial expressions (happiness, neutral, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear).

Here we are using various machine learning methods to detect the emotion in a particular image (and attempt to apply it real time). We used hog feature extraction technique(we intend to try more feature extraction techniques as project progresses). Used KNN and Decision Tree Classifier for classificatio and got nearly 70% accuracy.
